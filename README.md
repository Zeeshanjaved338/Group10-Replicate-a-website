Netflix Clone - Landing Page Project
We build a clone of the Netflix  landing page. We wanted to see if we could match their specific dark theme and layout using HTML and CSS.

Project Overview
We focused on making the site look as close to the official Netflix Pakistan homepage as possible. This included the main landing page with the "Trending Now" section and a separate Sign-In page and a pop functionality on clicking the trending now section cards.

What We implemented:

The Homepage Hero: We used a large background image with a dark gradient overlay so the text stays readable, just like the real website landing page.

Movie Carousels:
 We made a "Trending Now" section with the big numbers (1-10) behind the images. I used CSS to add the grey stroke effect to the numbers.

Interactive Modals:
 One of the most challenging parts was making the movie info pop up when a card is clicked. We have to used the CSS :target trick to do this without needing a lot of JavaScript.

Sign-In Page: 
We also built the signup.htm page which has the classic Netflix login box with semi-transparent backgrounds.

Mobile Friendly: 
We used Media Queries to make sure the "Reasons to Join" section and the footer look good on mobile phones by stacking the columns.
